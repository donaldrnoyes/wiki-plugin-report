# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Report Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The report plugin specifies when reports are due and how they should be delivered.

The plugin includes a server script that will email reports based on the plugin's schedule. Server operators may set conditions upon if and how email will be sent.
